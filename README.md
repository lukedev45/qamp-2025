# QAMP 2025 Cohort

This is the official repository for the QAMP 2025 cohort (October 2025 - January 2026) where projects and checkpoints are documented throughout the program.

_The administrators of this repo are Radha Pyari Sandhir (quantum-kittens) and Astri Cornish (Astri-Cornish)._

## What is QAMP?

Qiskit Advocate Mentorship Program (QAMP) is a program focused on bring new contributors into Qiskit open source software development where Qiskit advocates work on a 3-month projects under the guidance of mentors. It is an initiative designed to support growth and collaboration within our vibrant community. 

Access the QAMP information deck [here]([https://ibm.box.com/v/qamp2025_call](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-2025/blob/main/QAMP_call.pdf)).

*Mentees* can expect to learn how to contribute to quantum computing advancement. Participants more experienced in open-source development can hone and develop specialized skills. Mentees must be Qiskit advocates.

*Mentors* can expect to develop leadership and teamwork skills, while making a significant impact on the next generation of quantum developers and leaders.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Q: Who is eligible to apply?
A: Participating in QAMP as a mentee is exclusive to Qiskit advocates. You need to become a Qiskit advocate to apply for the program. Read [here](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/community#advocates) for more information about how to become a Qiskit advocate. 

Mentors do not need to be Qiskit advocates.


#### Q: How long is the mentorship program?
A: The official mentoring period is 3 months. See [here](#important-dates) for the important dates.

#### Q: How do a mentor and a mentee get matched?
A: You will be matched based on the project preference and interest areas indicated in your application form as well as the evidence you have provided to demonstrate your experience and commitment.




### For prospective mentees:

#### Q: Can mentees propose projects?
A: Yes! Mentees can propose project ideas by submitting them as a github issue [here](https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-2025/issues) during the application period. If a mentor is interested in your project, you will be matched to work on the project.

#### Q: I don't have much programming experience, can I still apply?
A: Yes! The mentorship program is meant for developing your skills. Some projects require only minimal programming experience. You will be able to learn and improve your programming skills with guidance of your mentor. Some projects focus on supporting individuals to make their first PR to Qiskit or the Qiskit ecosystem. You may also apply to a project that is less focused on code (e.g., tutorial or blog writing).

#### Q: What can I expect to gain out of being a QAMP mentee?
- Networking
- Improved skills in project topics
- Published papers or other deliverables 
- Professional development experience

#### Q: What is the expected time commitment?
Time commitment varies across projects and is noted on each project issue. However, we expect QAMP to require approximately 4-8 hours of your time per week.

#### Q: Is this program worth my time?
In previous QAMP surveys, 90% of responding mentees agreed or strongly agreed that the program improved their quantum skills.​

### For prospective mentors:

#### Q:  What can I expect to gain out of being a QAMP mentor?
